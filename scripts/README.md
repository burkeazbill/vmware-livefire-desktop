# scripts

If you wish to disable any of the scripts (but keep them in their respective subdirectories), 
simply rename the extension so that the filename ends in something OTHER THAN "sh"

The "login-updates.sh" script will be installed to /usr/local/bin as part of the 05-0install-desktop.sh script that 
gets called by the shell provisioner in packer.
